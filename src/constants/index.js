export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I am a dedicated, hard working and versatile full stack software engineer with a passion for creating efficient and user-friendly web applications along with an eye for creativity. Throughout my Columbia Engineering Bootcamp experience, I have worked with a variety of technologies, including React, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

With a deep curiosity for how things work, and I'm hoping it will evolve into a career where I continue to strive to learn and adapt to new challenges. I excel in collaborative work environments and enjoy solving complex problems to deliver high-quality solutions.
